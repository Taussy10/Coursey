 by default react native flex is columns and every 
 components goes down columns

 Always have dynamic theming: making Colors files and defining
 most used color by this you can change themeing of the app by chanign once 

 => know as implies sign 

    // you have to give the name of paras
    function normal(a, b , () => console.log("hello")) {
        console.log(a+ b);
    }
    normal(4 , 6)


    // this is the correct method
    // How it was workin g
    function normal(a, b , c , d) {
        // 2. value of first param = a 

        // 4. value of 2nd param = b 
        console.log(a+ b);
        // 5. console both the things

        c()
        //7. value of 3rd param = c and runs it

         d 
     // Won't execute just store the value of 4the params  
    }

    // 1.1st param = 4 
    // 3.2nd param = 4 

    // 6. 3rd param = function 
    normal(4 , 6 ,() => console.log("hello") ,() => console.log("Chuha") )

Higher order function uses when
1. asynchronous programming(not with will execute later)
2. 


when we write function when to  use when
1.  function normal(a, b , c , d) {console.log("Hello") , console.log("HI") }
2.  function normal(a, b , c , d) console.log("hello")

when need to  write single statments in the  body of function then no need to write {} 
and if multiple statements in body then write curly
